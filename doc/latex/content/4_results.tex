\section{Results and Analysis} \label{section:results}

To benchmark the \hyperref[section:algorithms]{implementations previously discussed}, we executed the following test set 3 %TODO: specify value
times, storing the results for analysis:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Naive, Line and Parallel implementations (across both C++ and Lua) with input matrices from $600 \times 600$ to $3000 \times 3000$ with size increments of $400$
    \item Line, Block and Parallel implementations (in C++) with input matrices from $4096 \times 4096$ to $10240 \times 10240$ with size increments of $2048$, with block sizes $128$, $256$ and $512$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Evaluation of a Single Core Implementation}

% C++ vs Lua (Naive vs Block)
% Line vs Block
% Block Size Comparison

\subsection{Performance Evaluation of a Multi-Core Implementation}

% Line vs Parallel 1 vs Parallel 2
