\section{Algorithms Explanation} \label{section:algorithms}

To see the effects of cache locality and parallel computing on matrix multiplication implementations, we used five different matrix multiplication algorithms, described in this section. These algorithms perform the same operations, ending in the same results, only differing by the order of the operations done, which, as we will see, will have crucial impacts on each algorithm's performance.
