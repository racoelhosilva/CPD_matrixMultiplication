\section{Conclusion} \label{section:conclusion}

In conclusion, this project allowed us to deepen our understanding of fundamental programming concepts, such as data accesses, with emphasis on the impacts of cache misses, and parallel computing. By implementing multiple valid approaches to the same problem and comparing their performance metrics, we were able to verify the concepts taught in the theoretical classes.

Developing the code across two languages, in our case C++ and Lua, also provided us with better insights in those languages, particularly C++, where we explored the Performance API (PAPI) for benchmarking and OpenMP for the multi-core programming. 

Overall, the project successfully met its objectives, giving us hands-on experience with the intricacies of parallel computing and demonstrating the performance capabilities of programs developed with memory layout and multi-core mechanisms in mind.
